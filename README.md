# z80pack on Pico-Eval-Board

Lately z80pack got better support for bare metal systems, like the
RP2040 microcontroller designed at Raspberry Pi. A dev prototype system
with a Pi Pico was build on breadboard and used as a research system.
While this is good for development, not everyone wants to wire a system
on breadboard with breakout boards for the tiny circuits. This also is
sensitive for moving arround and transportation, so we need something
more convenient.

For the Raspberry Pi Pico board a number of extension boards and headers
exist, the one used here is this:
